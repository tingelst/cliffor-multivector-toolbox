<h1>Clifford Algebras</h1>
<p>
Clifford algebras, developed by W.K. Clifford, finalized the fundamental concept of directed numbers. "Any Clifford algebra Cl(V) is generated from an inner-product
vector space (V, a · b : a, b ∈ V 7→ R) by Clifford’s geometric product setting the geometric product of any vector with itself equal to their inner product: aa = a · a. We
indeed have the universal property, that any isometry from the vector space V into an inner-product algebra A over the field K can be uniquely extended to an isometry
from the Clifford algebra Cl(V) into A. The Clifford algebra Cl(V) is the unique associative and multilinear algebra with this property" [1]</br>

<h1>Design Principles</h1>
<p>
The fundamental design principle of the toolbox is that operations on Clifford multivector 
arrays should work in the same way as normal Matlab operations on real and complex arrays. 
Therefore a simple guideline on using the toolbox is to do things as you normally would in 
Matlab. For example, to concatenate two arrays to make a larger array, you use square brackets, 
commas and colons, e.g.
<pre>
[A, B; C, D]
</pre>
will join four arrays to make a larger array in the form of a 2 x 2 matrix or block matrix. 
If it happens that any or all of A, B, C and D are Clifford multivector arrays, the toolbox 
will be invoked to concatenate them together using functions in the toolbox that overload the 
normal Matlab functions.

<h1>Save/Load (Matlab Functions)</h1>
<p>
A multivector variable can be saved to a .MAT file using the Matlab save function. 
It follows that a previously saved variable can be loaded using the load function:
MATLAB Save Function: <a href="matlab:doc save">save</a><br>
MATLAB Load Function: <a href="matlab:doc load">load</a><br>

<h1>Extracting Multivector Components</h1>
<p>
There are functions for extracting components from a multivector. Each of these functions returns a multivector. 
In the examples that follow, the following multivector was created previously:
<pre>
y =
 
   0.1420 e0  
 - 0.2554 e1   + 0.1517 e2   + 0.3448 e3   + 0.1034 e4  
 + 0.2188 e12  + 0.1537 e13  - 0.0642 e14  + 0.0622 e23  - 0.1665 e24  + 0.1879 e34 
 - 0.2426 e123 - 0.2261 e124 - 0.1712 e134 - 0.6227 e234
 + 0.3042 e1234
</pre>
<ul>
<li><h2>Using Bivector</h2>
bivector() can be used to extract the bivector element of a multivector (grade 2):
<pre>x = bivector(y)</pre>
This will extract something in the form: 
<pre>0.2188 e12  + 0.1537 e13  - 0.0642 e14  + 0.0622 e23  - 0.1665 e24  + 0.1879 e34</pre>
where we see that only bivector components are present.</li>
<li><h2>Using Even</h2>
even() can be used to extract all of the even grades of a multivector (scalar, bivector, quadrivector etc.):
<pre>x = even(y)</pre>
This will extract something in the form:    
<pre>
   0.1420 e0  
 + 0.2188 e12  + 0.1537 e13  - 0.0642 e14  + 0.0622 e23  - 0.1665 e24  + 0.1879 e34 
 + 0.3042 e1234</pre></li>
<li><h2>Using Grade</h2>
grade() can be used to extract a specific grade of vectors from the multivector (0 = scalar, 1 = vectors, 2 = bivectors etc.):
<pre>x = grade(y,3)</pre>
This will extract something in the form:
<pre>- 0.2426 e123 - 0.2261 e124 - 0.1712 e134 - 0.6227 e234</pre></li>
<li><h2>Using Odd</h2>
odd() can be used to extract all of the odd grades of a multivector (vector, trivector etc.):
<pre>x = odd(y)</pre>
This will extract something in the form:
<pre>
 - 0.2554 e1   + 0.1517 e2   + 0.3448 e3   + 0.1034 e4  
 - 0.2426 e123 - 0.2261 e124 - 0.1712 e134 - 0.6227 e234
</pre></li>
<li><h2>Using Part</h2>
part() can be used to extract the numeric value from a specific part of a multivector:
<pre>x = part(y,3)</pre>
This will extract the value from the third element in the multivector (as indexes start from 1 following the normal Matlab convention):
<pre>0.1517</pre></li>
<li><h2>Using Pseudoscalar</h2>
pseudoscalar() can be used to extract the psedoscalar element in a multivector (usually the highest grade):
<pre>x = pseudoscalar(y)</pre>
This will extract something in the form:
<pre>0.3042 e1234</pre></li>
<li><h2>Using Scalar</h2>
scalar() can be used to extract the scalar element in the multivector (usually denoted by e0):
<pre>x = scalar(y)</pre>
This will extract something in the form:
<pre>0.1420 e0</pre></li>
<li><h2>Using Trivector</h2>
trivector() can be used to extract the trivector element of a multivector (grade 3):
<pre>x = trivector(y)</pre>
This will extract something in the form: 
<pre>- 0.2426 e123 - 0.2261 e124 - 0.1712 e134 - 0.6227 e234</pre></li>
<li><h2>Using Vector</h2>
vector() can be used to extract the vector element of a multivector (grade 1):
<pre>x = vector(y)</pre>
This will extract something in the form: 
<pre> - 0.2554 e1   + 0.1517 e2   + 0.3448 e3   + 0.1034 e4</pre></li>
</ul>

<h1>Test Code - How to run</h1>
<p>
Once all of the necessary steps have been undertaken to install the toolbox under MATLAB, you may test the code to check
that the installation was successful. This is done from the MATLAB command window by typing the command: 
<pre>clifford_test</pre>
which will run tests on many parts of the toolbox and will allow you to confirm that installation is correct.
If correct it should end with the lines:
<pre>
Elapsed time is 600.803826 seconds.
All tests completed without error.
</pre>
</p>
<a name = "init"></a>
<h1>Initalising the Algebra</h1>
<p>
<h2>Implementation restrictions</h2>
As far as possible, we have designed the toolbox internal implementation so
that there are no restrictions other than available memory that will limit
the maximum dimension of algebra that can be initialized. When an algebra
is initialized with the function clifford_signature(p, q, r), an internal
descriptor is created. This is a global variable which is not by default
visible in the user's workspace, although it can be made visible by typing
the command 'global clifford_descriptor', or displayed in the command
window by the command 'descriptor'. Two key integer fields within the
descriptor determine the size of algebra: n is the number of basis vectors
e1, e2, e3, ..., en; and m is the total number of numeric components in a
multivector array. m is equal to 2^n.</br></br>

In order to initialise an algebra, the clifford_signature function has to
compute the multiplication table of the algebra. This is stored in two
tables, one for the sign, and one for the index. When two basis elements
are multiplied (e.g. e1 times e23) the product has a sign which depends on
the algebra, and the result must be stored in the appropriate element of
the multivector result - independent of the algebra (in the example e123).
The sign is computed by the function clifford_sign_table, which returns a
two-dimensional array of int8 values, and the size of this array is m^2
bytes. The index table is also m-by-m, but it must contain larger integers,
to permit the initialisation of algebras with more than 256 elements in
each multivector. The next available Matlab integer type has 16 bits, and
thus the size of the index array is 2 m^2 bytes. The 16-bit index type
"limits" the size of algebra to 65536 elements in each multivector. In
practice, this limit could not be reached because of limitations on memory
and the time to compute the multiplication table.</br></br>

So, the memory usage of the sign and index arrays is 3 m^2 bytes. An algebra
with n=10 (and therefore m=1024) requires 3M bytes of memory to store the
sign and index arrays. Adding one to n doubles the value of m, and therefore
quadruples the size of the sign and index arrays. With n=16, m=65536, and
3 m^2 = 12G bytes which is probably more than could be supported on most
personal computers in 2015.</br></br>

A second issue regarding size of algebra is the existence of parameterless
functions for the basis elements of the algebra. However, even with n=16 and
m=65536, it is not impossible to create this number of small function files
on disk. Each file is less than 500 bytes in size, so only 32K bytes of disk
would be needed to store them all.</br></br>

Multivectors are represented internally using cell arrays, one array for
each numeric component. Some of these arrays may be empty, representing
components with an exact zero value (or array of exact zeros to be precise).
The function dump(a) will display the content of a multivector for debugging
purposes. Each multivector contains a copy of the signature that was in use
when the multivector was created.</br></br>

The global variable clifford_descriptor contains the initialised parameters
of the algebra. This variable may be saved to a file using the Matlab save
function and loaded back in using load. For very large algebras where the
time taken to initialise the algebra is significant, saving the descriptor
to file could be much faster than re-initialising it every time.</br></br>

<h2>Single algebra paradigm</h2>
The current design of the toolbox assumes that one algebra is in use at any
time. However, each multivector that is created contains a copy of the
signature in use at the time it was created. This means that you can change
the current algebra, leaving multivectors in memory, and return later to an
algebra that you used previously by (re)initialising that algebra, and then
use the multivectors previously created.</br></br>

To initialise an algebra, use the function
<pre>
clifford_signature
</pre>.
This function takes two or three parameters, which are respectively the number 
of basis vectors with positive, negative and zero squares (conventionally these are called p, q and r). 
If r is omitted, it is taken to be zero. Calling this function without parameters causes a summary of 
the current algebra to be displayed. When you initialise an algebra for the first time, the multiplication 
table and other parameters of the algebra have to be computed. This can take significant time for larger 
algebras. However, on a second and subsequent intialization, even after restarting Matlab, the algebra is 
initialised from information saved to disk in a cache (see next section).

<h2>Descriptor cacheing</h2>
Initialisation of an algebra requires significant computation. From version
1.0 of the toolbox, the descriptors are written to file in a directory
called cache, and the function clifford_signature will load the descriptor
from this cache if it is available. The files in the cache are standard
Matlab MAT files. There are two possible issues with this implementation:</br></br>

1. The format of the descriptor may change in a later release of the
   toolbox, which could lead to incompatibility with cached descriptors.</br></br>

2. The format of the MAT file may change in a later release of MATLAB.</br></br>

Both of these issues can be simply handled by deleting the cache directory,
which will cause the clifford_signature function to re-create the cache as
it initialises new algebras. However, to reduce the need to do this in case
1, the toolbox writes the files to a hierarchy of sub-directories using the
major and minor version numbers of the toolbox to name the sub-directories.
This ensures that each version of the toolbox writes its cached files to
different sub-directories, so no conflict can occur if the descriptor
format is changed. Of course, the downside to this is that each new release
of the toolbox has to re-create all the descriptors as it initialises each
algebra.</br></br>

<h1>Data Types</h1>
<p>
Multivectors themselves and any objects associated with multivectors are of type clifford. 
You can initalise multivectors with the methods below using any numeric data type including int8 or double.

<h1>Creating Multivectors</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li><h2>randm</h2>
A random multivector in the current Clifford algebra can be created using:
<pre>x = randm</pre></li>
<li><h2>From Existing Real Arrays</h2>
Any existing numeric arrays, including those read in from files, may be used as the numerical
components of a multivector, but they will be stored in the scalar part, 
unless they are already multivectors.
<pre>
>> x = [1,2,3,4,5]

x =

     1     2     3     4     5

>> clifford(x)
 
ans =
 
     1x5 Cl(1,1) multivector array
 
>> show(ans)
 
ans =
 
e0 *
 
     1     2     3     4     5
</pre></li>
<li><h2>Using e1.* etc</h2>
Multivectors can be constructed by multiplying numeric arrays by the basis elements of the current algebra (these are implemented as parameterless functions by the toolbox):
<pre>x = e0*4 + e1*2 - e2*2 + e12*3</pre></li>
<li><h2>Clifford Constructor</h2>
A multivector can be constructed by providing the Clifford constructor function with the correct number of arguments for the current algebra, for example in Clifford(1,1):
<pre>
x = clifford(1,2,3,4)
 
x =
 
   1.0000 e0
 + 2.0000 e1 + 3.0000 e2
 + 4.0000 e12
</pre></li>
</ul>
