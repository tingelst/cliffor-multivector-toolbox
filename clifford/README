Clifford Multivector Toolbox for Matlab
---------------------------------------

After download, you will find detailed installation instructions in the
file Read_me.txt and release notes in the file Release_notes.txt.

This file provides a summary of what is needed to install the toolbox
before you download it.

1. You will need a functioning copy of Matlab. The toolbox may work under
   Octave, and this may be supported in a later release, but for now we
   are developing the toolbox with Matlab only.

2. Installation consists of the following steps:

   a. Unzip the downloaded file.
   b. Place the unzipped folder in a suitable location (NOT inside the
      MATLAB installation itself where MATLAB toolboxes are installed)
   c. Add the toolbox folder to the Matlab path.
   d. (Optional) Run the test code provided as a check that all is OK.
