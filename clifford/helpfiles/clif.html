<h1>Clifford Multivector Toolbox</h1>
<p>
For a general overview of Clifford algebra,
and how it is handled by the
toolbox, see the <a href="overview.html">overview</a> page.
For a detailed list of functions, see the
<a href="alphabetical.html">alphabetical</a> or
<a href="categorical.html">categorized</a> lists.
</p>
<p>
Many Matlab&reg; functions will work with Clifford Algebra, because all
the functions called are overloaded by the toolbox, and the semantics of
the multivector version are consistent with what the Matlab&reg; function
expects. A <a href="matlist.html">list of these functions</a> is available.

Development of this toolbox was partially funded by a Scheme 4 (Research
in Pairs) grant number 41408 from the London Mathematical Society. This
grant funded a two-week visit by Stephen Sangwine to the International
Christian University in Tokyo to work with Eckhard Hitzer in March 2015.

The online help documentation for this toolbox was made possible by the
award of a Frontrunner student placement number FR1516207 funded by the
University of Essex from June to August 2016. Ryan Stuart was employed on
the placement and created an initial set of documentation files and pages
for the toolbox, based on the infrastructure already in place for <a href = "http://qtfm.sourceforge.net">QTFM</a>.
