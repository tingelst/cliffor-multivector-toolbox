% Development of this toolbox was partially funded by a Scheme 4 (Research
% in Pairs) grant number 41408 from the London Mathematical Society. This
% grant funded a two-week visit by Stephen Sangwine to the International
% Christian University in Tokyo to work with Eckhard Hitzer in March 2015.

% The online help documentation for this toolbox was made possible by the
% award of a Frontrunner student placement number FR1516207 funded by the
% University of Essex from June to August 2016. Ryan Stuart was employed on
% the placement and created an initial set of documentation files and pages
% for the toolbox, based on the infrastructure already in place for QTFM
% (see above for link). For copyright information on the documentation see
